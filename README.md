## CptS 122 - Programming Assignments
This repository includes all of my programming assignments for the CptS 122 course taken in college.

### Programming Assignment 1
In this assignment, I analyzed data generated from a fitness device stored in a .csv file.<br><br>
My tasks included filtering data for the target patient, deduping entries, and data cleansing. I defined a C struct to store Fitbit data and an array to hold 24 hours of minute data. The program didn't require user input but instead displayed results.<br><br>
I computed total calories, distance walked, floors climbed, and steps taken, along with the average heart rate. Additionally, I reported the max steps taken in one minute and the longest consecutive range of poor sleep. Output was written to _Results.csv_ and displayed on the screen, including summary statistics and details of the analyzed data.

### Programming Assignment 2 and 3
For this assignment, I developed a basic digital music manager (DMM) with a text-based interface. Options include: loading, storing, displaying, editing, rating, playing, shuffling, and exiting.<br><br>
- _Load_ reads records from a file called musicPlayList.csv into a dynamic doubly linked list of records, each record containing attributes like artist, album title, song title, genre, song length, number of times played, and rating.
- _Store_ writes the current records to musicPlayList.csv.
- _Display_ prints all records or those matching an artist.
- _Edit_ allows the modifying of attributes of a record.
- _Rate_ allows assigning a 1-5 rating to a song.
- _Play_ starts playing each song in order, displaying record contents for a short period.
- _Exit_ saves the most recent list to musicPlayList.csv, overwriting previous contents.

### Programming Assignment 9
This programming assignment was to create a game using C++ that demonstrated our knowledge of inheritence, classes, abstraction, and more.<br><br>
This PA isn't included in this repository, but you can find it [here](https://github.com/aryputh/cpts-122-final). We decided to use Unreal Engine and to form a simple treasure hunt game.
